NAT - Nerdery Assessment Test

Questions for the Nerdery:
1. Navigation - there wasn't a drop-down indicated in the PSD do you need me to create a drop-down for the navigational items as well?
2. Carousel - For the carousel piece it says that it should "support up to a max of 4 images". Does this mean displaying only a max of 4 in the visible carousel area but that there could be more than that waiting to cycle through or only a maximum of 4 images will every be loaded to this area? Also it says that there may be less than four. In the event that there are less would you like the images to scale to fill in the entire space or would you rather them simply stack to the left and leave an empty space for the missing image?
3. Carousel - It also mentions that we are not supposed to use frameworks, plugins and polyfills for HTML, CSS,
& JS. Is it acceptable to write our own jQuery plugin for the slideshow or would you rather it not be written as a plugin? Do you prefer to see it as vanilla JS?
4. In the instructions it said that the ads can remain static but I am assuming that you would still like them implemented as linked items is this a correct assumption?
5. Browse Categories (left side of the PSD) - should the headings be mad collapsible?
6. Browse Categories (left side of the PSD) - each of the listed items are being assumed as linked items but there is no hover state accounted for in the PSD is there a preference as to what you would like to see for the hover state or are you expecting us to decide what that should be?
7. Recent Articles (middle of the PSD) - should these three articles be linked items as well? If so do you want the text and images to be clickable or one of the two?
8. Sign Up for Our Newsletter (right side of the PSD) - for the check boxes do you wish for them to be defaulted at a checked state or is it just that way in the PSD to demonstrate that they are check boxes?
9. Sign Up for Our Newsletter (right side of the PSD) - for the "Sign Up" button no hover state was provided. What would you like to see for the hover state?
10. Current Contests (right side of the PSD) - should the items be clickable and if so should the hit area be just around the image, the text, or both?
11. Popular Videos (bottom f the PSD) - is there a hover effect that you would like to see on the individual video thumbnails?
12. Footer - no hover state was provided in the PSD for the text or the social media icons. What would you like to see for the text and do you even want a hover effect for the social media icons?


Answers from Nerdery:
1. There is no drop down in the navigation
2. There is a max of 4 items total (you can assume this is enforced in the CMS). Stack thumbnails to the left with an empty space if there are less than 4.
3. You can write your own jQuery plugin if that is your preference, although if you’re comfortable I’d like to see how you organize code outside the context of a plugin. You may still use jQuery.
4. Yes, link the ads.
5. The categories on the left are not collapsible
6. A simple underline will suffice
7. Just the title should be a link
8. The default state will be checked
9. An underline on the text when hovering the button will suffice
10. The entire item should be clickable
11. No hove effect on the video thumbnails
12. The text should display an underline, there is no hover state for the social icons.
