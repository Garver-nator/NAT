NAT - Nerdery Assessment Test

Questions for the Nerdery:
1. Do the groupings under "Browse Categories" need to be collapsible?
2. Should the Social Media icons in the footer be given some kind of hover state?
3. There wasn't a hover color given for the "Sign Up" button in the "Sign Up for Our Newsletter" form on the right side of the NAT. Should I put one in or should I leave it as the static solid color?
4. For the carousel the NAT says that it needs to handle a maximum of 4 images but there may be less. Does that mean max of 4 displayed in the carousel but there might be more rotating through or that there will only ever be four images total?
